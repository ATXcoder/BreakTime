# BreakTime
BreakTime is a simple Windows app to help track when it is time to take a break from your computer. It is important for a number of health reasons to stop and getup after sitting at a desk for extended periods of time. 

This app allows you to enter how long you want a work session to be as well as how long a break session should be (by default it is set to remind you to take a 10 minute break every 50 minutes).
