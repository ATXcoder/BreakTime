BreakTime is a simple Windows app to help track when it is time to take a break from your computer. It is important for a number of health reasons to stop and getup after sitting at a desk for extended periods of time. 

## Custom Work and Break Times
This app allows you to enter how long you want a work session to be as well as how long a break session should be (by default it is set to remind you to take a 10 minute break every 50 minutes). 

## Context Menu
Start, Stop, Resume, and even add 5 minutes to the current Work or Break session can be easily done by right-clicking on the notification icon in the tray.

## Minimize and Hide
Not only can you simple minimize the app, but you can also hide it thuse completely removing it from your start bar and leaving the notification icon in the tray. Simply double click in the app icon to show the app again.

## Notification Pop-Ups
Thanks to the [Notification-Popup-Window](https://github.com/Tulpep/Notification-Popup-Window) library, the application will display a gentle notice in the style of a Microsoft Office like pop-up informing you when it is time to take a break or resume working.
